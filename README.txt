長益 PuddingMeow：
my tasks:
    - daySimulation
        - interface
            // 3 moves each day
            // different locations
        - eventFunction
            〇 branching choices
        - daily schedule (one week, for now)
            // something similar to event function, to allow for flexibility.
        〇 flag system
        - events
            - story writing!!!
    - save system
        // 3 file slots？
        // should prompt saving at each end of day.
        // no mid-day saving! save ourselves some work.

currently working on:
    - add ability to modify flags to event function.
